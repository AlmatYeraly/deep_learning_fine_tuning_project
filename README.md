# My contributions to No LLMit Final Group Project for CS 7643 Fall 2023

The custom_trainer.py file includes the custom trainer function that I built for our final project using huggingface's transformers and pytorch. This was mainly done to change the loss functions to KL Divergence. 

The project report pdf file is the full final report we wrote for the course. My contributions to the final report were portions of the report that explain what is context distillation and the results from it.
